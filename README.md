# ChirpFilter

Mod for Cities:Skylines.

Filters non-informative chirps from chirper. No more chirps about lost wallets and vacations. The mod only filters the games original messages, so mods that insert custom chirps won't be affected. 

The mod filters the messages by category, so you will only get chirps about things that require your attentation.
